# Fire Detection using YOLOv9



## Overview

This project utilizes YOLOv9, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, to detect fires in images and video streams. The system aims to enhance early fire detection capabilities using deep learning.

## Features

- *Real-time Detection*: Achieves real-time fire detection in video streams.
- *High Accuracy*: YOLOv9 ensures high accuracy in identifying fire instances.
- *Versatility*: Can be deployed in various environments, including surveillance systems and IoT devices.
- *Scalability*: Designed to handle large volumes of video data for continuous monitoring.

## How It Works

1. *Object Detection*: YOLOv9 detects objects in frames.
2. *Classification*: Identifies if the detected object is a fire.
3. *Alert System*: Alerts authorities or triggers alarms in case of fire detection.
